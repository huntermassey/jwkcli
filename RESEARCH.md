# Collection of links obtained during research of potential use

I like to try and collect all the links I run across as I work on and research a project and prior work in a space. Below is that collection!

## Cool implementations

* https://github.com/square/go-jose
    * Interesting cli tool in-tree: https://github.com/square/go-jose/tree/v2/jwk-keygen
* A rather complete JOSE library: https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx
* Existing JOSE cli, fills some of my use case but I want to build my own and target my specific use-case https://github.com/antoniomo/jose-tool
    * Fills one desired use-case of JWK generation

## Stackoverflow

* A simple review with well known JWKS json https://stackoverflow.com/a/61200654
* JWK, vs JWE, vs JWS, vs JW... https://stackoverflow.com/a/74257561 
    * highly useful for starting out as a beginner
